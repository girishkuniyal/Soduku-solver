I want GUI in window also.(Because this qt project GUI is for linux version only).\r\n\r\n#Steps of Using Soduku Solver(Linux user with Qt creater/library only):\r\n\r\nSTEP 1\r\n\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/girishkuniyal/soduku-solver/blob/master/screenshot/soduku1.png)\r\n\r\nSTEP 2\r\n\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/girishkuniyal/soduku-solver/blob/master/screenshot/soduku2.png)\r\n\r\nSTEP 1\r\n\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/girishkuniyal/soduku-solver/blob/master/screenshot/soduku3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#Step for using solver (Windows user):\r\n\r\nuser will give a soduku for solving contains digit from 1 to 6.\r\nthe empty space in soduku is represented by 0;\r\nexample of 6x6 soduku problem is :\r\n\r\n\t2\t0\t1\t6\t3\t4\r\n\t0\t4\t6\t2\t5\t0\t\r\n\t1\t2\t5\t0\t6\t3\r\n\t4\t6\t3\t5\t0\t2\t\r\n\t0\t1\t4\t0\t2\t6\r\n\t6\t3\t2\t1\t0\t5\r\n\t\r\nwhere 0 represents blank space in soduku.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTION FOR USING SODUKU-SOLVER FOR 6X6 MATRIX\r\n\r\nSTEP 1\r\n\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/girishkuniyal/soduku-solver/blob/master/screenshot/step1.png)\r\n\r\nSTEP 2\r\n\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/girishkuniyal/soduku-solver/blob/master/screenshot/step2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#Download Instruction\r\nDownload executable(.exe) file from bin directory. or \r\n[Download from Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/soduku-solver/?source=directory)\r\n\r\nThank you!!\r\n \r\n",
