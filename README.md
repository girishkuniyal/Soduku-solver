**Step for using solver (Windows user):**

user will give a soduku for solving contains digit from 1 to 6.
the empty space in soduku is represented by 0;
example of 6x6 soduku problem is :

	2	0	1	6	3	4
	0	4	6	2	5	0	
	1	2	5	0	6	3
	4	6	3	5	0	2	
	0	1	4	0	2	6
	6	3	2	1	0	5
	
where 0 represents blank space in soduku.
