its a effort for creating a source code for soduku matrix solver which is 6x6 and accepts digit from 1 to 6. 
it is a code for creating a program which is able to solve soduku matrix of 6x6.the soduku puzzle is given by user and solution is given by program.
Rule to handle program:
1.)user will give a soduku for solving contains digit from 1 to 6.
