# soduku-solver
its a effort for creating a source code for soduku matrix solver which is 6x6 and accepts digit from 1 to 6. 
it is a code for creating a program which is able to solve soduku matrix of 6x6.the soduku puzzle is given by user and solution is given by program.
Rule to handle program:
1.)user will give a soduku for solving contains digit from 1 to 6.
2.)the empty space in soduku is represented by 0;
example of 6x6 soduku problem is :
	2	0	1	6	3	4
	0	4	6	2	5	0	
	1	2	5	0	6	3
	4	6	3	5	0	2	
	0	1	4	0	2	6
	6	3	2	1	0	5
where 0 represents blank space in soduku.
thank you!
